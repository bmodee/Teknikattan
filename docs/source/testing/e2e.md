# End to end tests

The end to end tests are tests that test the entire system, both the server and the client.
They are stored in the folder `/client/src/e2e/`.
Both the client and the server need to be running for the end to end tests to work.
The tests are run using the [VS Code task](../development/vscode.md) `Run e2e tests`.
