You are also able to connect to an active competition from the same screen you used to login.

## Editor

The editor allows you to edit competitions.
You can add, remove and reorder slides.
You can add, delete and edit teams, text and image components, question type, correcting instructions and background image.

## Active competitions

You can also start a competition.
This will let other people join it with codes that can be seen either before or after starting a presentation.
Then when you switch slides, start the timer or show the current score it will also happen for every other person connected to the same competition.

Depending on which code someone uses to join an active competition they will see different things, which we call different views.
The team view will allow the user to answer the questions.
The judge view will allow the user to see correct answers and give a score to the questions answered by a team.
The audience view will show the current slide.
