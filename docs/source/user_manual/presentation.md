# Active competitions

There are many different views during a competition.
Below we describe how to start a competition, how to join a competition and how the different kinds of views work.

## Operator

There is two ways to start a competition.
The first way is to navigate to the competition manager, press the three dots "..." and press "Starta".
You will then enter the operator view.
From here you will be able to go bewteen slides with the "<" and ">" buttons or start the timer, both will be synced between all clients connected to that competition.
You will also be able to view the scores for the teams and view all codes to the competition.

## Team

You can also join the competition with codes.
This can either be done by pasting the link that can be copied when listing the codes or can be typed by hand on the login page.
All the views have a different purpose and therefore looks a little bit different.

The team view (or the code for one of the teams) will be used by teams.
It shows the current slide and allows the user to answer questions on the slide that will be saved.
