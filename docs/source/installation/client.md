# Installing the client

It is recommended to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to install and use the client, but it is not necessary.
In order to install the client, you will need to do the following:

Install [Node (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Clone [teknikattan-scoring-system](https://gitlab.liu.se/tddd96-grupp11/teknikattan-scoring-system).

Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the cloned project.

Install all client dependencies:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

You should now be ready to start the client.
Try it by running `npm run start`.
A webpage should open where you can see the [login page](../user_manual/login.md).
