# Introduction to our system

This system allows a user to create, edit and host competitions.
Below it is in short described what the system allows you to do.
If you want a more exact description (with pictures!), see the [user manual](../user_manual.rst)

## Login

After logging in you will be able to see all competitions and edit them.
If you're an admin you will also be able to see all users and edit them.
You will also be able to connect to an active competition from the same screen you used to login.

## Editor

The editor allows you to edit competitions.
You can add, remove and reorder slides.
You can add, delete and edit:

- teams
- text and image components
- questions
- question types
- correcting instructions
- background image.

## Active competitions

You can also start a competition.
This will let other people join it with codes that can be seen either before or after starting a presentation.
Then when you switch slides, start the timer or show the current score, it will also happen for every other person connected to the same competition.

Depending on which code someone uses to join an active competition they will see different things, which we call different _views_.
The _team view_ will allow the user to answer the questions.
The _judge view_ will allow the user to see correct answers and give a score to the questions answered by a team.
The _audience view_ will show the current slide.
