# External programs

We also used some other programs help the development.

## Postman

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a program used to test API calls.
You can create and edit API calls, change the body, headers and even share what you have saved.
It's very helpful when developing APIs.

## DB Browser for SQlite

[DB Browser for SQlite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) is used to see what is currently stored in the database.
You can even edit values.
