### npm

`npm` is the node package manager.
Below we briefly describe how to use it.
All of the following snippets assume you are in the `client` folder.

To install a module, run `npm install <module>`.

To uninstall a module, run `npm uninstall <module>`.

To install all project dependencies, run `npm install`.

Remember to install the project dependencies whenever someone else has added new ones to the project.
